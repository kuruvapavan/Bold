        <pre>The sun is a huge ball of gases.
             <i><b> has a diameter of 1,392,000 km.</b></i>
              <h2>It is so huge that it can hold millions of planets inside it.</h2>
               <u>The Sun is mainly made up of hydrogen and helium gas. </u>
              <q> The surface of the Sun is known as the photosphere.</q>
               <strike> The photosphere is surrounded by a thin layer of gas known as the chromospheres.</strike>
               <strong>  Without the Sun, there would be no life on Earth.</strong> 
                 <small>There would be no plants, no animals and no human beings.</small>
                  As, all the living things on Earth get their energy from the Sun for their survival.</pre>
